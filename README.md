# axis-registry

Axis Registry is a contract for managing metadata related to Axis protocol auctions. This enables sellers to provide updated metadata and/or allowlists for their auctions, which can then be accessed through the [subgraph](https://github.com/Axis-Fi/subgraph).

See [IMetadataRegistry](./src/interfaces/IMetadataRegistry.sol) for the full interface.
